##### When should I arrive?

We will officially kick things off at 5:30pm. Please feel free to come hang out up to an hour beforehand. Nothing exciting will be happening, but there is some cool to stuff to look at on the farm.

##### But why are you getting married on a farm? Are there going to be animals?

Because we love farms! Sadly (or fortunately for some of you), there are no animals on this farm out of respect to guests with allergies or who do not want to smell muddy pigs while they eat. Yes, that was Megan's preferred venue.

##### What else is happening this weekend?

We suppose you could check out the *Vikings Begin* exhibition at the American Swedish Institute. Or, you could hang out with us Friday and/or Sunday! Check out the details here.

##### What should I wear?

Please dress however you will be most comfortable! “Casual Dress Code”, if you need something official. We will spend time outside on grass, so consider this when making shoe decisions.

##### Can I bring kids?

Yes! Preferably yours.

##### What will the weather be like?

After extensive research into local meteorological data, we can report the following:

* June 20 typically sees temperatures ranging from 62ºF to 77ºF, with a 41% chance of some type of precipitation. (uh-oh!)
* Volgograd, Russia (5,485 mi away) and Benxi, China (6,058 mi away) are the farthest locations with temperatures most similar to the Twin Cities.

The reception will take place in an historic barn without sophisticated climate control, so please plan accordingly.

##### I’m worried about my food allergy or dietary restrictions!

We have tried to be accommodating in our food options, but please let us know your restrictions so we can make sure you are safe and sated!

##### How do I get to Minnesota? Is it the same as Wisconsin? Where should I stay?

Minnesota is technically a different state than Wisconsin, but just barely. Please find this information (and more!) here.

##### Do I need to RSVP?

That would be nice. Please RSVP by April 27 here.

##### Where can I play pickleball?

If Kathleen tricks you into leaving the celebration for a pickleball match, it is a trap. However, the nearest court is XXXX, only XXX mi away.

*If you have any other questions, please reach out to either JC or Megan, or email [MiragliaQuirin2020@gmail.com](mailto:MiragliaQuirin2020@gmail.com)*
