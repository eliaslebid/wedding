##### What should I wear?

Please dress however you will be most comfortable! “Casual Dress Code”, if you need something official. We will spend time outside on grass, so consider this when making shoe decisions.

##### Can I bring kids?

Yes! Preferably yours.

##### What will the weather be like?

After extensive research into local meteorological data, we can report the following:

* June 20 typically sees temperatures ranging from 62F to 77F, with a 41% chance of some type of precipitation.
* Volgograd, Russia (5,485 mi away) and Benxi, China (6,058 mi away) are the farthest locations with temperatures most similar to the Twin Cities.

The reception will take place in an historic barn without sophisticated climate control, so please plan accordingly.
