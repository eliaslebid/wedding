### Megan

Originally from Ohio, the offspring of lifelong public servants, Megan has devoted their career to fighting for environmental justice, political change, and puppies. With a degree in zoology, Megan is a burgeoning urban farmer, working a 3,500 sq. foot plot of vegetables and native flora and caring for two dogs, six chickens, and, quite by accident, one turkey. Megan currently works as a fundraising consultant and chess instructor, a background known to put voters' hearts at ease.

A veteran of political campaigns from California to upstate New York and Washington, D.C., Megan has yet to enjoy the taste of victory, but there's always a first time.

### JC



To-date, JC's only successful campaign involved an eight-month recount.

### Stronger Together

Despite their poor track record working on the campaigns of others, JC and Megan are confident that, together, victory is guaranteed.
