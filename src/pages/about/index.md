### Megan

Originally from Ohio and from a family of public servants, Megan has devoted their career to fighting for environmental justice, political change, and puppies. With a degree in zoology, Megan is a burgeoning urban farmer, working a 3,500 sq ft plot of vegetables and native flora and caring for two dogs, six chickens, and, quite by accident, one turkey. Megan currently works as a fundraising consultant and chess instructor, a background known to put voters' hearts at ease.

A veteran of political campaigns from California to upstate New York and Washington, D.C., Megan has yet to enjoy the taste of victory, but there's always a first time.

### JC

A native of Little Canada, Minnesota, JC didn't actually visit the big Canada until Megan took him there in 2013. The youngest of his father's 11 children and the oldest of his mother's 1 child, JC grew up in a political family. His father was a state representative and his mother worked for Sen. Mondale and the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party; they introduced JC to politics at a young age, taking him to a Mondale/Ferraro rally in '84 and committing many instances of voter fraud because he liked to flip the switches and pull the levers in the voting booths.

JC went to college for computer science, and realized he preferred politics. He started working in politics and immediately realized they didn't know how to use computers. He's worked at the nexus of politics, government, and technology ever since, since he's good at spotting a good thing when he sees it (this is also why he signed on to the ticket with Megan). 

His father was a state representative from Rochester until Gov. Wendy Anderson asked him to work in his administration (and the voters decided they preferred a Republican), and his mother worked for Sen. Mondale before he was a VP or asked, "Where's the beef?" 

To date, JC's only successful campaign involved an eight-month recount.

### Stronger Together

Despite their poor track record working on the campaigns of others, JC and Megan are confident that, together, victory is guaranteed. 

They've been on the campaign trail for seven years, traveling the country coast-to-coast from Washington DC to California, hiring a great team that includes special advisers Radar & Annie along the way. 

Megan's favorite thing about JC is his vacuuming; JC's favorite thing about Megan is her willingness do what it takes to make the world a better place, even if it means getting her hands dirty (often "what it takes" involves cleaning chicken coops).
