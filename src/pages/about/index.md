### Megan

![Young Megan](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvjbm5qlr/image/upload/c_crop,g_custom,h_1300,w_1300/v1581202773/about/11709959_10206936781725599_3523722717878405974_o_i9zlwj.jpg) Originally from Ohio from a family of public servants, Megan's career has been devoted to fighting for environmental justice, political change, and puppies. With a degree in zoology, Megan is a burgeoning urban farmer, working a 3,500 sq ft plot of vegetables and native flora and caring for two dogs, six chickens, and — quite by accident — one turkey. Megan currently works as a fundraising consultant and chess instructor, a background assured to put voters' hearts at ease.

A veteran of political campaigns from California to upstate New York and Washington, D.C., Megan has yet to enjoy the taste of victory, but there's always a first time.

### JC

![Young JC](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvjbm5qlr/image/upload/v1581202773/about/Drum_Flag_JC_qheqv1.jpg) A native of Little Canada, Minnesota, JC didn't actually visit big Canada until 2013. The youngest of his father's 11 children and the oldest of his mother's 1 child, JC grew up in a political family. His father was a state representative and his mother worked for the Minnesota DFL; they introduced JC to politics at a young age, taking him to a Mondale/Ferraro rally in '84 and committing many, many instances of voter fraud because he liked to flip the switches and pull the levers in the voting booths.

JC went to college for computer science, and realized he preferred politics; upon graduation he started working in politics and immediately realized they didn't know how to use computers. He's worked at the nexus of politics, government, and technology ever since, since he can tell a good thing when he sees it (this is also why he signed on to the ticket with Megan).

To date, JC's only successful campaign involved an eight-month recount.

### Stronger Together

Megan and JC have been on the campaign trail together for seven years, traveling the country coast-to-coast from Washington, D.C. to California. They have assembled a great team along the way including Annie (a newcomer, but has the requisite hunger) and Radar, who has spent his entire life around politics.

Megan's favorite thing about JC is his dedication to cleaning up corruption (usually vacuuming); JC's favorite thing about Megan is their willingness to do what it takes to make the world a better place, even if it means getting their hands dirty (often "what it takes" involves cleaning chicken coops).

Despite their poor track record working on the campaigns of others, Megan and JC are confident that, together, victory is guaranteed. Especially if it involves spending an inordinate amount of time at the Minnesota State Fair.
