    **Minneapolis** has a more typical big city vibe, with a dense downtown,
    lots of restaurants, and popular neighborhoods. Expect city traffic and
    parking.


    **St. Paul** is more laid-back, with a less bustling downtown, plenty of
    good restaurants, but not the same foodie scene. While both cities have
    river access, St. Paul has a better view, and the beautiful capitol
    building.

**Minneapolis−Saint Paul International Airport ([MSP](https://www.mspairport.com/))** is the airport servicing the Twin Cities.

##### How to Get Around

You can take the [light rail](https://www.metrotransit.org/metro) Blue Line from the airport to Downtown Minneapolis, or transfer to the Green Line to the historic Union Deport to Lowertown Saint Paul.

There is also extensive bus service around the metro area if you are looking to avoid cars. Check out the [Metro Transit](https://www.metrotransit.org/trip-planner) website for more info.

The [venue](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bruentrup+Heritage+Farm+and+the+Maplewood+Historical+Society/@45.035173,-93.0090352,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xf2366bbf258a29da!8m2!3d45.035173!4d-93.0090352) is around 20 minutes (sans traffic) from Minneapolis and 10 minutes Saint Paul by car.

We strongly recommend taking a car to the venue. You can carpool, take a Lyft, and JC is learning that taxis are still a thing.

If you would like to rent a car, they can be [rented at the airport](https://www.mspairport.com/directions/ground-transportation/car-rentals).
