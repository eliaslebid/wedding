    We have two hotel room blocks: one in downtown Minneapolis and one in
    downtown Saint Paul. Feel free to stay at either - or neither!

  hotels:
    - address: TBD
      distance: Minnesota is 16 mi (around 20 minutes sans traffic) from our venue.
      name: Minneapolis Hotel - TBD
      notes: >-
        Minneapolis has a more typical big city vibe, with a dense downtown,
        lots of restaurants, and popular neighborhoods. Expect city traffic and
        parking.

    - address: TBD
      distance: St. Paul is 10 mi (around 10 minutes sans traffic) from our venue.
      name: The Saint Paul Hotel
      notes: >-
        St. Paul is more laid-back, with a less bustling downtown, plenty of
        good restaurants, but not the same foodie scene. While both cities have
        river access, St. Paul has a better view, and the beautiful capitol
        building.
