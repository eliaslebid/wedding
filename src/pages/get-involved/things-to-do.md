Welcome to Minnesota!

Unfortunately, you won't be here for the State Fair and probably won't have time for a canoe trip on the Boundary Waters, but we hope you'll come back.

Here are some other things you might enjoy *(distance from that city's hotel)*:

##### Minneapolis:

![JC, Megan, Cherry & Spoon](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvjbm5qlr/image/upload/c_crop,g_north,h_3100,w_3024/v1581202921/get_involved/IMG_20190905_184311_v06v9u.jpg)

* **[American Swedish Institute](https://www.asimn.org/)** *(1.8 mi)*\
    Turns out Sweden is more than IKEA. Check out the history museum, culture center, and mansion.
* **[Chain of Lakes](https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/parks__lakes/minneapolis_chain_of_lakes_regional_park/)** *(3 mi)*\
    Do you like bodies of water but have a tough time choosing just one? Want to know why they were called the Minneapolis Lakers before moving to LA? Minneapolis is called the City of Lakes for reason – check out a bunch at once connected by trails.
* **[Mill City Museum](https://www.mnhs.org/millcity)** *(1.5 mi)*\
    Who knew a museum on the history of flour and milling could be this stunning? Located next to the historic [Stone Arch Bridge](https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/historical_sites/stone_arch_bridge/), these provide the quintessential view of the Minneapolis riverfront.
* **[Minneapolis Institute of Art](https://new.artsmia.org/)** *(1.1 mi)*\
    Eclectic fine arts museum: all free!
* **[Minneapolis Sculpture Garden](https://walkerart.org/visit/garden)** *(.9 mi)* \
    An 11-acre park with 40+ iconic sculptures including the classic *Hahn/Cock*
* **[Minnehaha Falls](https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/parks__lakes/minnehaha_regional_park/)** *(6 mi)*\
      A surprising waterfall and short trail in the midst of the city

* **[Minnesota State Capitol](https://www.mnhs.org/capitol/activities)** *(1.0 mi)*\
    Designed by Cass Gilbert (who designed the U.S. Supreme Court building), the Minnesota Capitol is definitively — in JC's wholly unbiased opinion — in the top tier of capitol buildings in the country.
* **[Mississippi Riverwalk and Park](https://goo.gl/maps/ckZnNieWH3JLY4gg9)** *(0.3 mi)*\
    5.8 mi flat trail along the shoreline with view of trees and wildlife

    Museum with exhibits on technology, natural history, physical science, and mathematics

##### Surrounding Area:

* **[Mall of America](https://www.mallofamerica.com/)** *(10.8 mi from Mpls)*\
    You want over 96 acres of mall? We got it. Conveniently located next to MSP airport.\
  Fun fact: it was a filming location for both *D2: The Mighty Ducks* and Schwarzenegger holiday classic, *Jingle All the Way*.
* **[Stillwater](https://www.discoverstillwater.com/)** *(20.8 mi from St Paul)*\
    30 minutes from Minneapolis and just 15 minutes from our venue, this charming tourist town sits on the bank of the St. Croix River with walking paths, sightseeing tours, antique stores, and boating. The setting for *Grumpy Old Men* and *Beautiful Girls*, Stillwater is also known for its lift bridge and the enormous scoops of ice cream at [Nelson's](https://www.nelsonsicecream.biz/).
* **[Fort Snelling](http://www.mnhs.org/fortsnelling)** *(7.3 mi from St Paul)*\
    Fort Snelling, dating to the early 1800s, is located at the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers. It now features restored fortifications, and is set amongst the beauty of Fort Snelling State Park and the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge.
