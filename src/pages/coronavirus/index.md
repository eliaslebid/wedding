We are in the midst of a scary and unpredictable time as we face the spread of the coronavirus and evolving mitigation efforts across the world.

Our top priority is protecting the health of our family, friends, vendors, and anyone else we might directly or indirectly come in contact with.

We will continue to monitor the situation and keep you updated. We are in discussions with our venue and vendors and will be following recommendations from the CDC and WHO as the situation progresses and will postpone our date if that is the best course of action.



*For those who have already purchased - or are planning to purchase - airline tickets, most airlines are offering very flexible flight credit/rescheduling right now, so please make sure to check their current policies.*
