    We are in the midst of a scary and unpredictable time as we face the spread
    of the coronavirus and evolving mitigation efforts across the world.  Our
    top priority is protecting the health of our family, friends, vendors, and
    anyone else we might directly or indirectly come in contact with. We are
    postponing our nuptials until 2021. More information to come.

Megan and JC have chosen each other as running mates in the most anticipated campaign of <strike>2020</strike> 2021.

As our dearest family, friends, supporters, and those that tolerate our goofy jokes, we hope you will join us in celebration, love, and laughter next summer in Minnesota.
